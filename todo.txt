To do file for red-green web-based game.

= to do =
 - add single-user mode = regular timed trivia game, without moderator
   - use per-user game data
     - make a new directory: user-game-data
       - have a game data file per user
         - modify read_game_data/write_game-data
   - make link so user can move ahead when they are ready
   - don't put timer on show_answer page (so user can stop and get a sandwhich)
   - make it so that in regular mode, only admin can change game state
   - get rid of "still-in" logic for single-user mode
     - add score for top data bar instead
   - add link so user can use the first available guest account

 - add a 'watcher-only' view
   - this could be used in a presentation setting, so you don't have to have
     coordinated slides
   - would advance automatically through game
     - if we have timeout for

 - make a help page?

 - work on performance:
   - change to use UNIX socket, instead of 127.0.0.1:3031, for interface between
     nginx and uwsgi
   - use static pages
     - generate static pages for each state transition
     - Javascript to load static page
       - do minimal processing in rg.cgi, and send back user_id,
         still_in status, and name of static page to load
       - Javascript should load static page via nginx
     - make multiple pages per question/round
       - every combination answers, indicators, and result messages
   - add 'key' to question data (so users can't guess the next form
     and load the static html page)
   - don't import stuff that's not needed
     - only import valid_user_ids on registration
     - only import trivia or rps when being used
   - use shortcut to find next last_game_file_name
     - don't scan directory every time
     - use a global variable, and just check one filename ahead
       - fall back to directory scan if that doesn't work
   - remove answers from user files - ??
     - eliminate: clear_user_answers()
     - check places where user file is read/written and remove last_answer field
     - get rid of last_answer field in:
       - read_user()
       - clear_user_answers()
       - update_user_status()
       - save_answer()
   - move users to faster (in-memory) storage
     - need to support read from disk, in case script relaunches
     - avoid reading some or all user data on every client refresh
       - read data for admin stats using in-memory dictionary
       - could put user alias in cookie, and only read status from still_in_dir
     - avoid writing to all user data
       - remove last_answer (see above)
       - remove status?? (no, only admin writes to all users)

 - show stats on show_answers and show_results page:
   - number of users with correct/incorrect answers
   - number of users eliminated this round, number still-in
   - make a stats file that can be read by all users
     - have admin write to the file
     - have everyone else only read the file
 - show number of each answer on the qwaiting and rwaiting pages, for admin
 - remove all FIXTHIS items
 - fix all bugs (see below)
 - add notice message when user is eliminated
 - make the player screen pretty
   - change page colors
   - add graphics
   - user nicer layout
 - add score to user, and display on "done" page.
   - add score to user file?
     - it's read on every page load anyway
     - requires writing the score on each question (could be 1000 writes
       for each question)
     - we write 'still_in' to user file on each answer, so adding score
       adds no significant overhead
   - could score at end, by processing all answer files, instead of as-you-go
 - in admin controls: if still_in_count > 15, disable declare_winners
 - add alternate options to rps:
   - rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock
   - windows, linux, mac
   - Linus, Greg, Andrew
   - Intel, Arm, RiscV
   - add additional (optional) text to rps game
 - use answer value as answer code, instead of 'red', 'green', or 'both'
   - use a flag to indicate game mode:
     - red-green vs. multiple-choice trivia
 - coalesce trivia and rps into a single state machine
   - use mode to alter behavior of pages
   - use question/round, answer/result
   - designate first rps round in trivia/rps data file
 - use a markup language for the question pages, instead of pure html
   - use wiki page to create content, then user a generator to convert
     into trivia.py file
     - hand editing the trivia.py was a major pain point
   - create page converter (trivia.py generator)
 - write documentation
 - create standalone mode (not controlled by admin)
   - use timeout feature
   - automatically advance to each question, after a timeout
   - need to put phase and state per-user (in a cookie?)
 - add timeout for question
   - write javascript timer to submit form if user doesn't do it in time
   - put timeout value per question in trivia data 

== rejected todos ==
 - add 'logout' link for users
 - prevent someone from taking over another person's session
   - all you have to do is know the confirmation number, and then you put it
     in a cookie as your user_id, and it causes mayhem
   - could validate IP address?
   - too much for now

== fix bugs ==
 - sometimes, the test server and client browser get stuck
   - I have to ctrl-C the server and restart it
     - when running single-process python local cgi server
