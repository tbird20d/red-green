Q. What questions have been revealed (or used)?
A. Through the git repository, all questions have been revealed to
the public.  However, when playing the game in the closing game session at
ELC or ELC Europe, not all questions have been used.

Here is where we left off for each event:
 - ELC 2020 - last question used was question 20, about submarines
   - questions 21-30 were not used
 - ELCE 2020 - last question used was ??? (I don't recall)
   - questions xx-yy were not used
 - ELC 2021 - last question used was question 19 
   - questions 20-29 were not used

The reason for noting this is that some historical questions might still
be useful in future games.
