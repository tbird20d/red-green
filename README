== quickstart ==
To start a new game, you can just and access the cgi script (rg.cgi)
and click 'reset', then click 'really reset!!'

The main view is the admin view.  Press "player view" to see the
screen the player would have.  Press "auto view" for an automatically
updated (every 2 seconds) player view.

== Running under another web server ==
To run on a machine with an existing web server,
put rg.cgi into /usr/lib/cgi-bin, and change the
data path to where you put the trivia.py and rps.py files.  The data
path must be read/writable by the cgi script (which means the
web server).

Then point your browser at: http://server.address/cgi-bin/rg.cgi
for the CGI version of the script, or to
Then point your browser at: http://server.address/rg
for the WSGI verison of the script

== Running with local web server ==
To run on a machine without a web server, run ./start_server.

Then point your browser at: http://localhost:8000/rg.cgi

To log in as admin, use this url:
http://localhost:8000/rg.cgi?user_id=admin_game_admin

== Running with apache2 ==
I added the following line to /etc/apache2/conf-available/wsgi.conf
WSGIScriptAlias /rg /usr/lib/cgi-bin/rg.cgi

== pre-game ==
Remove user registration files in the rgdata directory
Remove winner files in the rgdata directory
('make clean' will do this)

== Operating the game ==
From the admin screen,

You can administer the game and display the player view on
a single machine, using two browsers.

If using this to display a player view for an audience,
the machine should have the capability to
show a full-screen browser on one screen (the projected screen),
and a separate browser on another screen.

The game progresses in 2 sets of rounds, for two different games:
1 Red-green trivia game
2 rock-paper-scissors game

Every operation performed (link clicked, or data entry submitted)
changes the game's data file.
If you click on the wrong thing, or enter the wrong data, you can
click 'undo' to revert to a previous game state.
