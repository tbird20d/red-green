green and red more than 14 times

There were 14 for the Ingenuity helicopter, (including 1 while the
helicopter was stowed in the Perserverance rover, during the rover
landing), and 1 "landing" by the descent stage (Linux was used for EDL
video work)

== IOT: Real or fake

== license news

Q.25 (license) The FSF recently blogged about:
 green - finally making a GPL v4 version of the license
 red - Writing their own version of the DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin)

answer:
 red - writing their own version of the DCO

They want something that provides more of the capabilities that copyright
assignment provides, since some projects (notably gcc) have started
accepting DCOs in place of copyright assignment, and the FSF doesn't think
any of the the current industry-standard DCOs are adequate for this.

== Linux kernel

Q.1 (linux) The currently released version of Linux is: 
   green - 5.15-rc5
   red - 5.14.6

red: 5.14.6

A release "candidate" doesn't count as a released kernel.
And the current rc number is -rc3, not -rc5

----
Q.2 (linux) A group of academics got in trouble for what this past year?
 green - submitting patches with intentionally security bugs to the Linux kernel
 red - disclosing security flaws in the Linux kernel, without first notifying the kernel community

green - University of Minnesota researchers submitted some patches
to various mailing lists, that contained known flaws.  Their stated intention
was not to introduce bugs, but rather to test kernel security review practices.
This caused great consternation.

Q.13 (linux) printk has been changed in the 5.15 Linux kernel with the ability to:
 green - automatically translate messages into other languages besides English
 red - get a list of all printk message strings included in the kernel

answer: red - get a list of all printk messages included in the kernel

The purpose is to allow checking that kernel messages that are checked
by diagnostics tools are still present, despite kernel code changes.

----

Q.14 (linux) The 5.15 kernel now uses the -Werror flag by default.
  The intended result is that:
 green - any compiler warning is converted into an error that will halt the build
 red - certain errors (specified in a special variable) are ignored as warnings

Answer:
 green - any compiler warning is converted into an error that will halt the build

Q.12 (linux) PREEMPT_RT has finally been merged into the mainstream Linux kernel
   green - True
   red - False

answer:
  red - False

Significant parts of the PREEMPT_RT patch were merged in the 5.13 and 5.15
kernels, but there are still some parts remaining:  175 patches, affetcing
215 files, 1350+ 2650- lines.  A few items, such related to cpu_chill() and
NOHZ remain.

source: https://marketresearchtelecast.com/linux-central-real-time-patches-integrated-after-17-years/161932

Note: While researching this, I found articles announcing that PREEMPT_RT
was close to being integrated into mainline in 2015, 2017 2019, 2020, and 2021.

Q.11 (science) Scientist recently demonstrate two ways to create truly random numbers
extremely quickly using a laser.  Which solution was quicker:
  green - a laser reflecting with itself in an special micro-cavity
  red - a laser interacting with the quantum vacuum state

answer
  green - a laser reflecting with itself in an special micro-cavity

Both of these were demonstrated this year.
green = 250 terabytes per second
red = 18.8 gigabits per second

The 'vacuum state' solution was susceptible to external noise which could
bias (and de-randomize) the output, which had to removed in post-processing.

Q.18 (science) New technology has been refined (pun intended) that can power a
   bus from garbage.  It uses:
  green - human waste (poo and pee)
  red - banana peels and beer

Answer:
Recent work by the University of Bristol's Robotics Laboratory,
has taken existing Microbial Fuel Cells technology, and has
minituarized it to demonstrate MFCs that are smaller than
a AA battery, with similar performance

The 'banana peels and beer' is from a scene where Doc Brown is filling
a "Mr. Fusion" device in the movie "Back to the Future".  Note:
"Mr. Fusion" is a fictional device.
